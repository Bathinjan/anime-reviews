# Bath's Anime Reviews
Built using React and JS.

### [Visit the Webpage Here](https://bathinjan.github.io/anime-reviews/)

 Uses the MyAnimeList API to make anime recommendations:

 - Look for recommendations based on genre, rating, or linked PV
 - Create and curate a watchlist
 - Laugh at my stupid Tag reviews

## August 2023 Build
Doesn't do anything quite yet! Loads from static page data.js to simulate pulling from MAL's API.

As I continue to get better in React and back-end, it should have more features soon!
